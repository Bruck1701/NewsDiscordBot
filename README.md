# News Discord Bot

This is a Google news client bot. It fetches the headlines from Google News using pygooglenews library,
parses the news into embeds and sends to a discord channel. 

# Installation instruction

To run the bot locally, I recommend installing a python virtual environment:
```
python3.x -m venv <virtual env name>
```

then install the requirements

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```


you can change the default language and country in default_values.py
